# Prolog

This repository aims to hold predicates and excerpts written in Prolog.

## Predicates

PROLOG predicates could be found on the following files:
* ``predicados.pl`` - basic/generic PROLOG predicates.
* ``problemas.pl`` - some more complex predicates.
* ``distancias/distancias_test.pl`` - travel problem solved using PROLOG predicates.

In order to run predicates, use the following command (and change the filename): ``swipl predicados.pl``.

## Tests

Tests are available in ``predicados_test.pl`` and ``problemas_test.pl`` files.

In order to run tests, use the following command (and change the filename):
``swipl -g run_tests -t halt predicados_test.pl``.
