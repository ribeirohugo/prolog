# Prolog

This repository aims to hold predicates and excerpts written in Prolog.

## Predicates

Predicates are located in ``predicados.pl`` and ``problemas.pl`` files. 

In order to run predicates, use the following command (and change the filename): ``swipl predicados.pl``.

## Tests

Tests are available in ``predicados_test.pl`` and ``problemas_test.pl`` files.

In order to run tests, use the following command (and change the filename):
``swipl -g run_tests -t halt predicados_test.pl``.
